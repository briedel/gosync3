Standard binding free energies are frequently sought in drug design. According to implicit ligand theory, standard binding free energies can be determined from binding potential of mean force (PMF) calculations from different receptor structures. Binding PMFs are a special type of binding free energy in which the receptor is rigid. The purpose of this project is to develop methods for estimating binding PMFs.&lt;br/&gt;

Project Description: Glass-forming liquids exhibit dramatical slowdown upon cooling, which may be controlled by the growing amorphous order that emerges due to the rarefaction of metastable states in the rugged free-energy landscape. The amorphous order is well captured by point-to-set correlations, and their measurements are indispensable in testing ideas surrounding this new order parameter. To attain good statistics on point-to-set observables, however, requires a huge number of independent simulations. Exploration of many parameter ranges -- such as temperature or confinement parameters -- further increases the need for parallel computing. The high throughout computing thus provides an ideal tool for investigating the notion of the growing amorphous order in glassy systems.&lt;br/&gt;

Project Description: The molecular machines associated with biological membranes are particularly remarkable. Membrane-associated proteins play an essential role in controlling the bidirectional flow of material and information, and as such, they are truly devices able to accomplish complex tasks. These include ion channels, transporters, pumps, receptors, kinases, and phosphatases.&lt;br/&gt;
These proteins, like any machine, need to change shape and visit many conformational states to perform their function. Our project is aimed at gaining a deep mechanistic perspective of such protein function, linking structure to dynamics, by characterizing the free energy landscape that governs the key functional motions.&lt;br/&gt;

Porject Description: Centaurs are icy objects in the outer solar system whose orbits cross those of the giant planets. It is thought that most Centaurs originate from the solar system's Kuiper Belt, a reservoir of icy bodies orbiting just beyond Neptune. However, a few Centaurs with very large orbital inclinations and/or mean orbital distances cannot be well-explained with a Kuiper Belt origin. Alternatively, it has been proposed that these outlier Cenaturs may come from the Oort Cloud, a spherical halo of icy objects that extends over halfway to the nearest star. In this project we will simulate the production of Centaurs from the Oort Cloud using numerical orbital integrations. Following this, we will run our simulated orbits/objects through a sky survey simulator to compare our simulated "detections" with the real sample of known objects. Thus, we will be able to evaluate whether the Oort Cloud is a potential source of Centaurs with extreme orbits.&lt;br/&gt;

Project Description: To give you a brief idea, I am trying to identify the information flow among several brain regions in rats in the neuronal level. The rats were actively doing a aperture discrimination task (whether a gate opened wide or narrow).  I wish to find not only the static neuronal circuitry of the sensory input, but also the dynamics of the flow across time.&lt;br/&gt;

Project Description: Our research is primarily focused on the transmission and evolution of two zoonotic pathogens, enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) and Salmonella. These pathogens reside in the intestinal tracts of animal hosts where they encounter diverse microbial communities, fluctuating nutrient levels, and myriad host factors. Transmission between hosts requires these pathogens to survive varied environmental conditions. The general stress protection system (regulated by the alternative sigma factor, σs) is known to play a central role in environmental persistence and transmission. Acid and desiccation tolerance are two transmission-associated phenotypes that are dependent upon σs –regulated genes. We are also investigating the role of prophage in fitness. EHEC harbor multiple lambda-like prophage and cryptic phage remnants in their genome that facilitate genomic rearrangements, gene duplications, and deletions by homologous recombination.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
We are investigating how these phage-mediated genomic rearrangements influence the persistence of EHEC in its bovine host and the environment. The goals of our research are to use results from these fundamental studies in the development of strategies to reduce pathogen transmission.&lt;br/&gt;

Project Description: Missing data and genotyping errors are common features of microsatellite data sets used to infer the genetic structure of natural populations.  We used simulated data to quantify the effect of these data aberrations on the accuracy of population structure inference.  Data sets were simulated under the coalescent and ranged from panmictic to highly subdivided with complex, randomly generated, population histories.  Models describing the characteristic patterns of missing data and genotyping error in real microsatellite data sets were developed, and used to modify the simulated data sets.  Performance of an ordination, a tree based, and a model based Bayesian method of population structure inference was evaluated before and after data set modifications.  The ability to recover correct population clusters decreased as missing data increased.  The rate of decrease was similar among analytical procedures, thus no single analytical approach was preferable when&lt;br/&gt;
faced with incomplete data.  Researchers should expect to retrieve 3–4% fewer correct clusters for every 1% of a data matrix made up of missing data using these methods.  For every 1% of a matrix that contained erroneous genotypes, approximately 1–2% fewer correct clusters were recovered using ordination and tree based methods.  A Bayesian procedure that minimizes the deviation from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium in order to assign individuals to clusters performed better as genotyping error increased.

Project Description: Missing data and genotyping errors are common features of microsatellite data sets used to infer the genetic structure of natural populations.  We used simulated data to quantify the effect of these data aberrations on the accuracy of population structure inference.  Data sets were simulated under the coalescent and ranged from panmictic to highly subdivided with complex, randomly generated, population histories.  Models describing the characteristic patterns of missing data and genotyping error in real microsatellite data sets were developed, and used to modify the simulated data sets.  Performance of an ordination, a tree based, and a model based Bayesian method of population structure inference was evaluated before and after data set modifications.  The ability to recover correct population clusters decreased as missing data increased.  The rate of decrease was similar among analytical procedures, thus no single analytical approach was preferable when
faced with incomplete data.  Researchers should expect to retrieve 34% fewer correct clusters for every 1% of a data matrix made up of missing data using these methods.  For every 1% of a matrix that contained erroneous genotypes, approximately 12% fewer correct clusters were recovered using ordination and tree based methods.  A Bayesian procedure that minimizes the deviation from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium in order to assign individuals to clusters performed better as genotyping error increased.  We attribute this surprising result to the inbreeding like nature of microsatellite genotyping error, and recommend the use of related analytical methods that explicitly account for inbreeding, as a means to mitigate the effect of genotyping error.

Project Description: Little is known about the evolutionary pathways enabling a protein to change its function to changing environmental needs, especially in regards to metabolism and toxicity. Evolution simulations that explicitly model the three-dimensional interaction of mutated proteins with their targets is a new approach that complements the ongoing explosion of directed evolution experiments. In this project, the evolutionary dynamics of a lattice representation of antibiotic resistance protein (beta lactamase) is studied by enhanced-sampling folding-binding simulations for an initial protein undergoing selection-dependent mutation to bind a new antibiotic. The goals of this work are to understand the fundamental physical bottlenecks and dynamical behavior of protein evolution. Important questions include the extent of dominant pathways (convergent evolution) and phase transitions in evolutionary rates (punctuated equilibrium). These principals and their structural underpinnings can also be used to inform rational design of antibiotics that exploit bottlenecks in pathogen mutational response.&lt;br/&gt;

Project Description: Though sexual reproduction is nearly ubiquitous in nature, its costs are substantial. Foremost among these costs are the twofold cost of males and the cost of destroying successful genetic associations. Understanding the paradox of the persistence of sex despite these detriments is a central question in evolutionary theory. In order to persist regardless of these disadvantages, the benefits of sexual reproduction must be substantial - offspring of sexual reproduction must have at least twice the fitness of asexual clones. The most generalizable hypotheses addressing the benefits of sex propose that genetic drift increases linkage disequilibrium, creating a surfeit of genomes with intermediate fitness. Sexual recombination eliminates linkage disequilibrium, thereby increasing genetic variation for fitness and improving the efficiency of natural selection. However, previous research using this framework has failed to address the biological reality of interactions between genes. Because the cost of destroying beneficial genetic interactions is one of the major costs of sex, this cannot be overlooked.  In this work, I use a computational gene network model in which genes interact and genetic interactions evolve to investigate the hypothesis that linkage disequilibrium decreases the fitness and adaptability of asexual populations. I test this both by evolving artificial organisms in conditions that will increase linkage disequilibrium, and by evolving them in an environment with a shifting optimum, which will make linkage disequilibrium more costly.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I am running a python script that runs populations of artificial gene networks (numerical matrices) through repeated rounds (on the order of 10s of thousands) of mutation, selection and reproduction, analyzing the evolutionary dynamics of these populations, and storing the data generated by this in text files.&lt;br/&gt;

Project Description: The dynamics and static properties of glassy systems can be studied in great detail by simple model systems, either those on a lattice or those consisting of mixtures of spherical particles. In order to do that, one can use any many techniques generally under the umbrella of Monte Carlo Sampling or Molecular Dynamics. In order to get detailed properties, is is often advantageous or necessary to run a large number of independent simulations, and to calculate properties averaged over these simulations. It may also be necessary to study these systems with a range of parameter values, e.g. temperature or system size. Hence, this problem lends itself well to high throughput computing, at least for cases where the individual simulations comprising a workflow are not too long.&lt;br/&gt;

Project Description: The dynamics and static properties of glassy systems can be studied in great detail by simple model systems, either those on a lattice or those consisting of mixtures of spherical particles. In order to do that, one can use any many techniques generally under the umbrella of Monte Carlo Sampling or Molecular Dynamics. In order to get detailed properties, is is often advantageous or necessary to run a large number of independent simulations, and to calculate properties averaged over these simulations.

Project Description: My research focuses on detecting patterns in physiological data of patients in an Intensive Care Unit setting, with the aim of constructing an early warning system.  The approach I am taking includes machine learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks, Hidden Markov Models, and Support Vector Machines.  I presently have limited computational resources for which to conduct this research.  The data I am using for training and validation is both static and time based information on 32,000 patients and includes approximately 30GB of raw data.  Additionally I have extremely high resolution data on 2,600 patient.  The search-space is prohibitively large for a single computer and even some of the smaller clusters.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I am employing an optimization methodology which allows for a differential evolution approach to incrementally improve a structurally adaptive model.   The methodology allows for parallel programming which is of course a necessity for distributed computing.&lt;br/&gt;

IceCube is the world's largest neutrino detector. It is located at the South Pole and  includes a cubic kilometer of instrumented ice.  IceCube searches for neutrinos from the most violent astrophysical sources: events like exploding stars, gamma ray bursts, and cataclysmic phenomena involving black holes and neutron stars. The IceCube telescope is a powerful tool to search for dark matter, and could reveal the new physical processes associated with the enigmatic origin of the highest energy particles in nature. In addition, exploring the background of neutrinos produced in the atmosphere, IceCube studies the neutrinos themselves; their energies far exceed those produced by accelerator beams.&lt;br/&gt;

Project Description: In educational assessment, several questions must be answered when constructing a test, such as "How many items are necessary for adequate knowledge measurement precision?", "How many field-test students are needed to adequately calibrate model parameters?", or "Which computerized adaptive testing (CAT) algorithm performs best?" For complex non-linear models, these questions are typically approached by simulation: Model parameters are calibrated (as if unknown) from simulated student item responses, or the emergent properties of particular CAT algorithms are investigated with a large number of simulated test takers. Since the design space grows quickly, many simulations are necessary to understand general trends.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Simulations throughout the test design space can be run independently, requiring little coordination between cores. Computations generally do not have high memory requirements or unusual library/code dependencies, and computations can be recovered from checkpoints easily. The large number of simulations suggests parallel computing, but the independence allows an asynchronous, distributed environment, such as OSG.&lt;br/&gt;

Project Description: Analysis of modern surgery presents many interesting computational challenges. The problems of access to data, data analysis, and interpretation of said analysis all present fundamental, unsolved difficulties to those in medical informatics. The focus of this project primarily involves data analysis where operations are still typically thought of holistically and conceptually, rather than algorithmically. This work is an attempt to change that by properly defining surgical procedures in a manner conducive to both education and analysis.&lt;br/&gt;

Project Description: Our lab studies the rhythms of the brain, recorded electrically as oscillations in voltage. These brain rhythms have been hypothesized to underlie functional communication between different brain regions, but the mechanism by which it does this is not clear. Additionally, it is not clear from a biophysical standpoint how these oscillations are generated. Our lab studies both noninvasive and clinical recordings from human subjects and patients in order to better understand these rhythms of the brain. For example, the project contact's personal research investigates the variations in the waveform shape of neural oscillations. Why are some oscillations nonsinusoidal (e.g. sawtooth), how does this impact neural communication, and how does this relate to high-level behaviors?&lt;br/&gt;

Project Description: The evolution of the universe is based on the idea of gravitational instability, whereby initial tiny fluctuations in the density of the Universe grew under the influence of gravity to form the large-scale gravitational structures we see around us today. These structures bend the trajectories of Cosmic Microwave Background photons through gravitational lensing, distorting its primordial polarization and converting divergent polarization patterns (E-modes) into curled polarization patterns (B-Modes). Imaging the lensing-generated B-modes, the POLARBEAR telescope will be able to shed light on all the components of the Universe influencing structure formation, such as neutrino mass and dark energy.&lt;br/&gt;

Project Description: The goal of this research is to develop a computational tool that can uncover the pathway and the transition states that exist when a molecule changes conformation or when it chemically changes. In many such circumstances, a process must overcome an energy barrier before proceeding to completion. If the size of the barrier is large compared to the available thermal energy, a process must rely on the occurrence of one or more rare events. For such circumstances, one would like to understand the reaction pathways so as to improve yields, or as in the case of protein folding, to understand the intermediate states. Many simple processes have been explored using theoretical tools such as molecular dynamics, where the movements of individual atoms are calculated. However, when the barrier is large, crossing the relevant barrier is indeed a very rare event. Although computer speeds have been doubling every 18 months (a consequence of Moore's law), the exponentially long waiting times necessary for barrier hopping pushes the required computational effort out of the feasibility range for all but the simplest models. To explore these barrier-limited processes, we are developing a novel computational technique to sample the paths themselves in a thermodynamically significant manner.&lt;br/&gt;

Project Description: Graph theory analyses would be investigated on weighted undirected matrices based on the probability of white matter connectivity between 26 regions comprising both cortical and subcortical structures on children with epilepsy with and without anxiety disorders. This project aims at investigating if there are fundamental differences in structural connectivity in children with idiopathic epilepsy with and without anxiety comorbidity. The neuropsychological implications of potential differences between groups would also be investigated.&lt;br/&gt;

Project Description: How large a role does history play in evolution? Do later events depend critically on specific earlier events, or do all events occur more or less independently? If a change occurs early in evolution, does it become easier or harder to revert the change as time proceeds? We intend to explore these ideas in the context of protein evolution, by simulating sequence evolution under purifying selection and then systematically permuting the order of amino-acid substitutions.&lt;br/&gt;

Project Description: The Center for Robust Decision Making on Climate and Energy Policy conducts research in four main areas:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
* Improving the fidelity of models used to forecast the impact of policies on future economic and climatic conditions. Many of the most decision-relevant aspects of climate and energy policy - for example, climate impacts and technological advances - are poorly or not at all represented in current policy analysis tools. The Center will build representations of the most important processes and increase model detail and resolution.&lt;br/&gt;
* Quantifying sensitivities and uncertainties in the parameters, processes, and impacts in models. RDCEP will develop methods to characterize the dependence of model output on input, parameter, and model uncertainty; incorporate these uncertainties in models; and study how to communicate probabilistic model output to decision makers.&lt;br/&gt;
* Identifying robust decisions in the face of uncertainty. The best policy is not necessarily that which produces the maximum return if all assumptions made are borne out, but the one that balances return and risk in the face of many uncertainties. The Center will develop models to identify robust strategies that perform well over a wide range of scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;
* Developing improved computational methods and numerical methods required to achieve these goals. New parallel stochastic dynamic programming, robust optimal control, and numerical optimization methods able to make full use of modern supercomputers will allow tools developed at the Center to incorporate sectoral and process detail and explore uncertainty, in ways not previously possible.&lt;br/&gt;

Project Description: The goal of the project is to develop fast, accurate algorithms for simulation and inference of stochastic differential equations (SDE).  Many SDE models of interest in science feature drift and diffusion coefficients with superlinear growth, which causes convergence and stability problems for many time integrators.  We seek improved methods that can overcome these problems, with a focus on correctly computing moments and densities of the solution.&lt;br/&gt;

phases as they relate to supercritical fluid chromatography&lt;br/&gt;
(SFC) is modeled with hybrid Monte Carlo methods. Carbon dioxide is the main component of the mobile phase in SFC, which typically operates above the critical point. Simulations use seven mole percent methanol in the mobile phase. The objective of the proposed work is understanding the interaction between mobile-phase molecules and the alkylsilane-coated silica stationary phase. The computational method is Monte Carlo simulation. Hybrid molecular dynamics moves explore conformations of eighteen-carbon alkylsilane chains bonded to silica substrate.&lt;br/&gt;

Project Description: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments have successfully discovered the last missing piece of the standard model (SM)—the elusive Higgs boson. However, no sign of any physics beyond the SM has been observed yet. Although the standard model has been extremely effective, many unsolved questions still remain.&lt;br/&gt;
The focus of our group is to study models of physics beyond the SM, which tries solve the aforementioned unsolved questions, and explore their possible signatures, at LHC experiments predominately. These models include Supersymmetric models, Grand Unified Theories, Left-Right Symmetric models and various Dark Matter models.&lt;br/&gt;
LHC is going through an upgrade now and it will start functioning again next year with increased energy. We are pursuing a number of projects trying to predict the possible signature of new physics, pertaining to various models described above, in upcoming LHC experiments. Owing to these we need sufficient comuting power and intend to run collider simulators including MadGraph, Pythia, PGS, Delphes etc.&lt;br/&gt;

Project Description: Hierarchical Approximate Bayesian Computation to Detect Community Response to&lt;br/&gt;
Sea Level Change in the Hawaiian Archipelago.  Methods that integrate population sampling from multiple taxa into a single analysis are a much needed addition to the comparative phylogeographic toolkit. Here we present a statistical framework for multi-species analysis based on hierarchical approximate Bayesian computation (hABC) for inferring community dynamics and concerted demographic response. Detecting community response to climate change is an important issue with regards to how species have and will react to past and future events. Furthermore, whether species responded individualistically or in concert is at the center of related questions about the abiotic and biotic determinants of community assembly. This method combines multi-taxon genetic datasets into a single analysis to determine the proportion of a contemporary community that historically expanded in a temporally clustered pulse as well as when the pulse occurred. We will apply this method to 59 species in the Hawaiian Archip ela!&lt;br/&gt;
go in order to examine community response of coral reef taxa to sea-level change in Hawaii. The method can accommodate dataset heterogeneity such as variability in effective population size, mutation rates, and sample sizes across species and utilizes borrowing strength from the simultaneous analysis of multiple species. This hABC framework used in a multi-taxa demographic context can increase our understanding of the impact of historical climate change by determining what proportion of the community responded in concert or independently, and can be used with a wide variety of comparative phylogeographic datasets as biota-wide DNA barcoding data sets accumulate.&lt;br/&gt;

Project Description: As next-generation sequencing continues to advance, it is outstripping Moore's Law, generating more data than can be analyzed with current techniques. We have developed discrete algorithms for detecting differential expression of genes in next-generation sequencing data. This project will explore how to run these algorithms on the OSG, including efficiently staging input files, running the algorithm on the grid, and collecting the results. We will apply the techniques to real and simulated expression data from Drosophila melanogaster.&lt;br/&gt;

Project Description: Periodic microphases universally emerge in systems for which short-range inter-particle attraction is frustrated by long-range repulsion. The morphological richness of these phases makes them desirable material targets, but our relatively coarse understanding of even simple models limits our grasp of their assembly. The OSG computing resources will enable us to explore more solutions of the equilibrium phase behavior of a family of similar microscopic microphase formers through specialized Monte Carlo simulations.&lt;br/&gt;

The morphological richness of these phases makes them desirable material targets, but our relatively coarse understanding of even simple models limits our grasp of their assembly. The OSG computing resources will enable us to explore more solutions of the equilibrium phase behavior of a family of similar microscopic microphase formers through specialized Monte Carlo simulations.

Project Description: This is an analysis of statewide data for all students in grades K-2. The aim of the analysis is to examine the effects of peers' achievement and composition effects on individual student achievement. This analysis requires mixed-effect modeling and quantile regression. R, and qrLMM package, will be used for analysis, 19 instances of analysis (one for each quantile .05 to .95 in .05 increments) will be conducted for each grade (k, 1, and 2). Each data set is less than 1GB, but requires approximately 6gb to run.&lt;br/&gt;

Project Description: In order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, experts have proposed requiring major carbon dioxide emitters to modify their infrastructure to collect carbon dioxide exhaust and compress it into a super-critical fluid for injection into a well-sealed geologic structure such as an exhausted oil or natural gas reservoir. We are therefore developing a tool to assess and monitor potential carbon capture and storage sites.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
We use large-scale reservoir simulations to investigate the mechanical stresses that would effect a reservoir as it is injected with super-critical carbon dioxide. Since we will not know the precise geologic structure of a given field site, this requires us to run a very large number of computationally-intensive simulations (10$^4$-10$^7$) in order to adequately investigate every possible geologic structure. These simulations can then be compared to measurements from the surface and from wells drilled into the reservoir, allowing us to identify which proposed structures best explain the data. This will allow us to infer the structure and state of the subsurface.&lt;br/&gt;
